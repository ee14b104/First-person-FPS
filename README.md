# First-person-FPS
First person FPS game in unity re-done using mirror for 2020. Based off the brackeys tutorial series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK57qdq_lak&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5PhGqsO7G4PsbEC_Al-kPZ&amp;index=1

Progress so far: https://youtu.be/RI_EHK_S0j8

I tried to build a multiplayer FPS game. However, in order to proceed further, I need to use either AWS or playfab to incorporate matchmaking services. 

AT this point, I can spawn multiple instances of the game on localhost and play.
